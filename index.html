            Hello, my name is Arumugam C, and I am a recent graduate with a strong foundation in Java development and Object-Oriented Programming. I have honed my skills in web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and responsive design frameworks like Bootstrap, as well as database management using MySQL. </li>
       <br> <li>
            I recently completed a Java Full Stack Developer course at Palle Technologies, where I gained hands-on experience in building and implementing web applications. My academic background includes a B.Tech in Information Tehnology from KSR College of Technology, where I maintained a CGA of 8.2</li>
           <br> <li>
                One of my key projects during my studies was developing “Anandha Hridhaya,” a home-based fetal heartbeat monitor. This project allowed me to combine my technical skills with my passion for making a meaningful impact, as it aims to help pregnant women easily monitor fetal heartbeats at home.
                </li>
